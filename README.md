Asihambeni is an application where users requests to share rides with other users. Users who will be driving requests to share a ride with users who will be passengers that will be travelling from a nearby pick-up point to a nearby drop-off point. Users who will be passengers requests to share a ride with users who will be driving that will be travelling from nearby their pick-up point to nearby their drop-off point. Drivers and passengers are then matched, and passengers are notified about matches and have to choose their preferred driver. Drivers that are chosen have to accept if they would like to travel with those passengers that chose them or if they still have available seats. Passengers are notified if their chosen driver rejected them so the can find another as soon as possible.
