# Travis [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Sbonis/Asihambeni-.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Sbonis/Asihambeni-)

The project is aimed at creating the share a ride app, that is, 
it prompt users if they want to share rides to a perticular shared destination.

OVERVIEW 

The way it works is that a user needs to register first for database storage, and after that the user is directed to the home page,
where he/she can choose if he wants to share the ride, that is, if he/she would like to be a driver or a passager. If the user is 
would like to be a passager he requests a scheduled ride, and notifications will be sent out to the correct match, that is, if there is 
an available driver going to the same destination, a notification will be pushed to that driver and he either accepts or rejects the request.

We have used android and firebase technologies to develop the App.
